More than a Hobbie! is an interview of Corey Burton conducted by Scott Chernoff and published in Star Wars Insider 111. Burton discusses how he initially got involved in Star Wars, his brief foray into the original trilogy voicing Hobbie Klivian in Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, voicing Luke Skywalker for a children's book, and later meeting Mark Hamill. He also talks extensively on his characters in The Clone Wars: Count Dooku, Ziro the Hutt, and Cad Bane. The article was later reprinted in Star Wars Insider Special Edition 2013.
