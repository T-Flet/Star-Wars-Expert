"As they shot past, I heard the shriek of their engines and my fighter shuddered in their wake. Only two of us survived that initial pass. Then they broke into tight packs and came back to finish us off. My wingman was obliterated."
â€•Excerpt from the Eyewitness Report of Lieutenant BlairI
A wingman fought with resistance fighters at the Battle of Slotern against the Galactic Empire sometime during the Empire's reign before or in 1 BBY. The pilot was the wingman of Lieutenant Blair during the battle. They were being attacked by TIE fighters, but they were piloting craft that were older than the TIEs and were considered to be ancient. All of the resistance pilots except for Blair and the wingman were killed by the TIEs on the first pass. The TIEs formed up into pakcs and came at them on a second pass, killing the wingman. Blair was the only survivor of the two-minute-long battle.

Behind the scenes
This wingman was first mentioned in the databank of the LucasArts video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, which was released in 2010.
