     
Force-sensitive holding cells were a form of technology designed to effectively prevent powerful Force-sensitive individuals from escaping using their Force abilities.

History
They were used widely during the height of the Great Jedi Purge following the Clone Wars, though little is known about them except that one of these held Luke Skywalker during his capture by the reborn Emperor Palpatine on a customized Lictor-class dungeon ship. It may be similar to the Sith containment cells located on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
