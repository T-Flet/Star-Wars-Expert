An Imperial shuttle was a tri-winged type of shuttle used by the Sith Empire. During the Sacking of Coruscant in the Great Galactic War, they were used as a means of transporting personnel and equipment to and from the occupied planet of Coruscant. The Sith Emperor had a personal shuttle that was kept in Kaas City for his private use. There also existed a smaller variant of the shuttle, which was used far more frequently.
