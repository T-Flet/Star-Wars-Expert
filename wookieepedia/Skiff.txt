"You're with me. The rest of you, get on that skiff. Do your best to act Imperial."
―Athex
Skiff was a term which could be used to describe a number of different types of vehicle, including both starships and atmospheric vehicles. The Hutt crime lord Jabba owned several skiffs, which he used to transport prisoners to the Great Pit of Carkoon. Jedi Padawan Kevmo Zink found that skiffs were excellent craft for carrying out split rolls.
Some skiffs were made out of parts from the Galactic Empire, one have a laser cannon turret, the spotlight, the ladder, and the rope, and other four did not have a weapon, instead having three spotlights.
