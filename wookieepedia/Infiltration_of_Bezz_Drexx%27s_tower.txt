"Senator Drexx must have considerable wealth to stage an event this large.""A little too much wealth, perhaps. I have long suspected him of taking bribes from the Separatists, but I have no proof. I want everyone to keep their eyes open. If we can get some hard evidence, we may be able to bring him to justice."
―Padmé Amidala and Bail Prestor Organa
Suspecting that Senator Bezz Drexx was taking bribes from the Separatists,
Senators Bail Organa and Padmé Amidala, as well as the former's aide Sheltay Retrac and the latter's protocol droid C-3PO, attended a party hosted by Drexx in his tower on Coruscant. In truth, however, they had come to Drexx's event in order to infiltrate his tower and uncover evidence to support their theory. Amidala and Retrac ventured further into the tower on their own, eventually discovering the proof they sought in the form of Corporate Alliance Magistrate Passel Argente's uncle supplying Drexx with a case full of credits in exchange for his continued loyalty to the Separatists.
