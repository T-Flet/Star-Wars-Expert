Behind the scenes
Michael Sheard, when debunking claims that a younger Kendal Ozzel would appear in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, the last installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, stated in a 2004 interview that if he were coming back for the film, he wouldn't play Ozzel because of his age but that he could instead play Ozzel's father. The finished film included neither Ozzel nor any of his relatives.
