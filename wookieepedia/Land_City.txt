"Welcome to Cloud City. Not to be confused with Land City and Sea City, of course. But seriously, don't go to the surface and look for them, it's a gaseous nightmare down there."
â€•A civilian of Cloud City
Land City was a city located on the gas giant Bespin's surface. At some point after the construction of Cloud City, a city in the clouds of the gas giant, a civilian told visitors of Cloud City not to confuse the city with Land City and Sea City, another city located in Bespin's sea. She also warned those who approached her not to look for the cities, as she considered the surface of Bespin a "gaseous nightmare."

Behind the scenes
Land City was mentioned in the 2022 video game LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga develoepd by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros.
