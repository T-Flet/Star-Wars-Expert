"What do we do without the sarge?""The reg manual says the next—"
―Clone troopers Fives and Echo after the death of their sergeant
Clone Sergeant, also known as clone trooper sergeant, was a rank held by clone troopers in the Galactic Republic's Grand Army who commanded squads of nine troopers. The four sergeants of a platoon were in turn led by their respective Clone Lieutenant. Standard Phase I sergeants wore armor featuring four green circles on the left breastplate as well as a stripe of pesto down the length of each arm, vertically up the middle of the helmet and laterally around the visor.
At least one clone trooper regulation manual contained information on what clones should do if their sergeant was unable to lead them. Bearers of the rank included Slick of a squad, O'Niner, Stew, Crasher of the Clone Youth Brigade, Appo of the 501st Legion, Sinker of the 104th Battalion, and Hunter of Clone Force 99.
