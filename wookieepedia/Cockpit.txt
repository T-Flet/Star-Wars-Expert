"Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, so that's what I'm going to do."
―Anakin Skywalker, explaining his reasoning for staying in a cockpit
     The cockpit of the Millennium Falcon  
The cockpit or control pod was, usually, the primary center of control for various kinds of vehicles. Pilots operated their vessels from cockpits, managing a variety of instruments that controlled the vehicle's speed, direction, and other operations. Anakin Skywalker was once ordered to stay in the cockpit of an N-1 starfighter during the Battle of Naboo in order to stay out of harm's way. Skywalker inadvertently flew the craft into battle, however. Although cockpits were normally a part of a vessel's main body, Podracer cockpits were tethered to the engines they controlled via cables. Some ground vehicles had an open cockpit, such as the All Terrain Reconnaissance Transport (AT-RT) walker.
