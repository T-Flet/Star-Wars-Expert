"Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end."
―Wald
Wald was a Rodian male slave who lived on Tatooine during the time of the Naboo Crisis. He was one of Anakin Skywalker's playmates in the Mos Espa Slave Quarters. He and Kitster Banai, along with the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, formed Anakin's pit team at the Boonta Eve Classic podrace. At the time, Wald was six years old. Along with Kitster and many others, Wald was eventually rescued from slavery by Sabé and Tonra and made a life for himself with many former slaves at a colony on Gabredor III.
