The title of Surface Marshal, or Surface Marshall, and alternatively named as Army Sector Commander, and simply Marshall, was used by the commander of a sector army; the Imperial Army forces within a Sector Group. Usually, it was merely another titled bestowed onto the Moff or Grand Moff who commanded the Sector Group. During the Imperial Period, Marshall VeNiste served as the Army Sector Commander of the Trans-Nebular sector, and dispatched a communique to Imperial forces on Goroth Prime that TIE/LN starfighters were subordinate to General Anderton Kloff when stationed planetside, an order Admiral Val DeGoort ordered his forces to obey.

Behind the scenes
The title of Surface Marshal was introduced in the Imperial Sourcebook; the same publication shows a rank plaque for a Priority Sector High Commander, which corresponds to the badge worn by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, except for a lack of code cylinders. This may have been the insignia of the Surface Marshal/High Admiral of an Oversector.
