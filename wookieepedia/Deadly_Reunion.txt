Plot summary
Luke returns to the rebel base on Kabal only to realize it's under imperial attack. He flees the base with Han, Leia, Chewie and the droids. but they are chased by the imperials. They find a place to hide in a ship graveyard orbiting a collapsed star, but after the imperial threat is over, they realize they can't leave. They hear a strange voice and Luke and Han decide to go investigate. They find that the source of the voice was Arakkus, an old imperial scientist suffering from a deadly illness. Arakkus created the graveyard for his final experiment and it's only purpose was to lure ships to it, causing the ships to be trapped because of the collapsed star's gravitational pull. To add insult to injury, Luke and Han can't even kill Arakkus, because his protective suit will blow up the negatron charges placed around the graveyard. After Luke and Han return to the falcon, Luke hatches a plan. They go back to dr. Arakkus and kill him, setting off the negatron charges. After this they run back to the falcon and escape the graveyard, propelled by the exploding negatron charges.
