Sentient species prehistory      The Wellspring of Life  
The universe begins forming.
The galaxy is formed around a super-massive black hole.
Midi-chlorians are birthed from the Wellspring of Life. They are microscopic symbiotic organisms in all living things that connect the Living Force—the energy of all life—to the Cosmic Force, allowing the will of the all-encompassing energy field known as the Force to communicate with lifeforms.
The Father, the Son, and the Daughter exist as powerful Force wielders who come to live in the ethereal realm of Mortis.
Billions of years before the Imperial Era, mineral matter that would infuse rock walls on the planet Ilum with valuable constituents, including rare crystals such as the Force-attuned kyber, begin to accumulate.
Billions to millions of years before the Imperial Era, lava flows on Dagobah and form Mount Dagger before disappearing to allow for the flourishing of non-sentient life.
A non-sentient species lives on the world of Bravais, eventually evolving into the sentient Bravaisian.
A non-sentient species lives on the planet Crul millions of years before they evolve into the sentient Crolute.
A primitive species lives on the planet Abednedo, eventually evolving into the sentient Abednedo.

Fleeing civil war on Grizmallt, human refugees make Nabu their new home, discovering the presence of Gungans while settling in. The humans and the Gungans make war against each other in the next few decades before agreeing to live separately. Gungan society had flourished on the world in the preceding millennia after the sudden departure of the Elders, a reptilian sentient civilization that colonized Nabu and waged war against the indigenes. Before the Elders' arrival, the Gungans had lived on Nabu in large nomadic tribes for millennia.      The Gungans and the Elders lived on Naboo together until the latter civilization's sudden withdrawal, leaving ruins in the swamplands.  
Later, the Gungan tribes are united under Boss Gallo and commence the building of Otoh Gunga as their capital city. Meanwhile, the humans, calling themselves "the Naboo," split into warring factions; the Time of Suffering is begun.

All participants are petrified by the superweapon, including a witch who led the Sith forces, although an entity known as the Presence remained in a Sith holocron within the Malachor temple.

By the time of the Sith's defeat (exact chronology undefined)      The fiery world of Mustafar  
Before the time of the Galactic Republic, the lushly forested planet Mustafar was inhabited by off-worlder Lady Corvax, who lived in harmony with the native Mustafarians along with her husband. The latter died as a result of an attack on Mustafar, leading to Corvax's theft of the most sacred Mustafarian relic, the Bright Star, in an attempt to use it in a ritual to resurrect her love. The ritual failed; instead, the Bright Star's energies pushed Mustafar into a new orbit, reducing the world to an unbalanced, chaotic state. A volcanic wasteland is created as tiny Mustafar is torn between gas giants Lefrani and Jestefad. Thus, Sith seeking the secrets of eternal life were attracted to the world.
Radaki had left the Jedi Order, believing that Jedi should retain their family ties and wealth. Thus he was seduced by the dark side of the force, becoming the Sith Lord Darth Krall.

The Brotherhood of Darkness, an army of the Sith in which Darth Bane served, are defeated by the Jedi's Army of Light as a result of infighting amongst themselves. The Sith, who once numbered thousands, are driven into hiding and are eventually thought extinct.
The sole Sith survivor, Darth Bane, creates the Grand Plan—a plot to destroy the Jedi and the Republic from within for the coming of Sith rule over the galaxy—and establishes the Rule of Two, a lineage of Sith who would operate in the shadows, preserving the Sith's vendetta against the Jedi whilst preparing for their own return. Centuries before the Clone Wars, the Rule of Two is revealed to the Jedi Order, though still they presume the Sith's eradication and believe that Bane's plan is ruined with his defeat allegedly at the hands of his apprentice, Darth Zannah, in a duel on the Inner Rim planet Ambria. This pattern is repeated by nearly all Sith thereafter.
The Sith Lord becomes the last of his kind to be laid to rest on Moraband's Valley of the Dark Lords.
The Sith Wars waged between the Republic and the Sith Empire has ended by this point. The Sith Wars saw the participation of the Jedi Order on the side of the Republic as well as the participation of the Chiss Ascendancy, which encountered multiple alien species before retreating to their borders.

At this point, the Outer Rim contains few well-mapped hyperspace lanes that allows those seeking adventure, as well as those seeking to evade the Republic's laws, to do so.<      With the breakdown of hyperspace throught the galaxy, Knights of the Jedi Order gathered at Starlight Beacon and were tasked to protect those stranded in the darkness of space.  
The Coruscant-based Republic Chancellor Lina Soh envisions a galaxy of Great Works that ranged from infrastructure to culture in an effort to expand the Republic's reaches, better connect the peoples of the galaxy, and bring inspiration and peace for all citizens. Efforts are made to negotiate a new peace treaty between the Quarren and the Mon Calamari, as well as to mass-produce bacta—a "miracle" substance primarily made from a barley originally cultivated on Thyferra that was intended to replace juvan—in the hopes of revolutionizing medicine.
As part of Chancellor Soh's pledge to maintain the Republic's hold on the hard-to-navigate Outer Rim, outreach programs are established in the Rim.
In the Galactic Frontier, the Jedi maintain order and justice at independently operated outposts, working closely with the Republic without direct assistance from the Coruscant Jedi Temple.

Starships across the galaxy are abruptly knocked out of hyperspace by missiles of debris from the Legacy Run, which also threaten to destroy space stations, moons, as well as planets. The Republic turns to the Jedi for help in saving lives and ending the crisis, and Jedi activity sees a significant increase.
Due to being delayed at the Starlight Beacon, Master Avar Kriss and Admiral Pevel Kronara become the first to respond to the disaster in the nearby Hetzal system, coordinating efforts to save citizens from aboard the Third Horizon.      Starlight Beacon better connected citizens, and the joint Jedi–Republic effort marked a golden age for life in the galaxy.  
Vernestra Rwoh, having been the Padawan of Stellan Gios, is made a Jedi Knight at the age of sixteen, becoming one of the youngest Knights of the Jedi Order in a generation.

The Jedi Wayseeker Orla Jareni, Jedi Knight Dez Rydan, Jedi Padawan Reath Silas, and Jedi Master Cohmac Vitus, as well as the cargo ship Vessel's Captain Leox Gyasi, co-pilot Affie Hollow, and the navigator Geode are ripped out of hyperspace as a result of the Great Disaster. They take refuge in a seemingly abandoned Amaxine Station.
Aboard the Amaxine Station, The Jedi passengers of the Vessel are disturbed by dark visions. Believing that a set of four binding statues contained the dark side influence, the Jedi take away the Force artifact for purification in the Sith shrine located beneath the Coruscant Jedi Temple. However, they are proven wrong, and realize that the statues had contained something else.
A series of Emergences come to threaten star systems across the galaxy.
Following the First Emergence in the Ab Dalis system, the Nihil attack an evacuation convoy belonging to Garello Technologies.
The Nihil attack Trymant IV as the Trymant IV disaster occurs. Zeen Mrala joins Lula Talisola's group of Jedi Padawans in defending Bralanak City from hyperspace debris and raiders.
The San Tekka clan, having risen from a family of hyperspace prospectors in the outer reaches of the galaxy to a dynasty privy to leading technology that allows Chancellor Soh's Republic to continue expanding safely to new areas about a century ago, operates alongside the galactic government as it responds to the Great Disaster.
While restoring the statues aboard the Amaxine Station, the Jedi are attacked by the Nihil. To defend themselves against overwhelming forces, the Jedi are forced to destroy the statues to unleash what it contained. A group of Drengir, who were put into stasis by the Sith through the binding statues long ago, are thus awakened from their slumber. While the Vessel's crew escape amidst the chaos, several Drengir are released into open space in the process.
The tragic poet Omar Berenko is reputed for residing at the Varykino artists' retreat on Naboo. Centuries before the year 22 BBY, the controversial Berenko was kidnapped from a scenic balcony overlooking the lakes after penning the disturbing and visionary epic poem titled Defense of Naboo in the Room of Morning Mists.      Omar Berenko penned the disturbing epic Defense of Naboo at his scenic lake retreat at Varykino.  
The Jedi High Council convenes to discuss the threat of the Nihil, and after a contested debate between Grandmaster Xo Lahru and Jedi Masters such as Yarael Poof, Rana Kant, Oppo Rancisis, Keaton Murag, Ada-Li Carro, and the stand-in of Grandmaster Yoda—who was on sabbatical from Council affairs—Ephru Shinn, approves a joint effort between the Jedi and the Republic in a mission against the Nihil as proposed by Chancellor Soh.

The Drengir abduct children on Sedri Minor.
Mission to Sedri Minor      Avar Kriss relies on the Song of the Force, battling the Drengir threat.  
The Nihil attack a Hutt Clan ship in the recently–Republic-aligned Kazlin system, prompting the Jedi Sskeer, Keeve Trennis, and the Kotabi bond-twins Terec and Ceret to investigate the resulting wreckage. Tracing the Hutt craft's origin to the Sedri system, Sskeer and Ceret take a T-1 shuttle to Sedri Minor. Avar Kriss and Vernestra Rwoh take the Ataraxia to join Trennis aboard the Hutt craft.
On Sedri Minor, Ceret is captured by the Drengir, and Kriss, Terec, Trennis—traveling aboard the Ataraxia—join Sskeer on the moon. Ceret yields to the powerful shadow cast by the Drengir and joins their collective mind. Sharing the same mind with Ceret, Terec also succumbs to the Drengir's influence and becomes crazed. While Kriss and Trennis confront the Drengir at their underground dwelling, Sskeer dispairs that he could not help Terec, who was uncontrollable and inconsolable.
While Avar Kriss and Keeve Trennis free Ceret as well as a local boy from the Drengir, they are surrounded by more Drengir, who are accompanied by Sskeer. Sskeer had had his mind joined with the Drengir's collective consciousness, and had grown a botanical, plant-like left arm. Sskeer captures Kriss' crew, and the secret history of the Drengir is revealed.
The Jedi and the Republic's Starlight Beacon is threatened by an age-old enemy.
The Drengir, hungry for Jedi, arrive at a serene and remote Jedi outpost that the Jedi Lily Tora-Asi lived in.
As a consequence of Menir's bitterness and unwillingness to accept any change, the Drengir plague the village Skirl on the planet Batuu.      Jedi glory was at its peak in the High Republic Era, although dark forces rising in the new frontier of the Outer Rim threatened the Force itself.

Secret mission to rebuild the Jedi Order
The Inquisitorius senses an echo in the Force from the former Padawan Cal Kestis in hiding on Bracca, and the Second Sister and Ninth Sister move to apprehend him. Following a tense confrontation, Kestis escapes the planet aboard the Stinger Mantis.
Cal Kestis sets out with former Jedi Cere Junda, pilot Greez Dritus, and the droid BD-1 to recover a holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children sealed within a vault on Bogano by the Jedi Master Eno Cordova. Following Cordova's instructions to open the Vault, Kestis travels to Zeffo, where a Project Auger outpost, by order of the Emperor himself, excavates the tombs of Zeffo Sages Eilram and Miktrull. Kestis is then tasked to find Chieftain Tarfful, a friend of Cordova's.
Saw Gerrera and the Partisans attack an Imperial Refinery on Kashyyyk. With the help of Cal Kestis, they successfully free numerous Wookiees, though Gerrera retreated from the planet in thinking that Kashyyyk was already lost. Several Partisan fighters choose to stay; led by Mari Kosan, they flee into the Shadowlands to join Tarfful's resistance.
Kestis, in addition to having a large bounty placed on him by the Haxion Brood, is wanted by the Imperial Inquisition. Nevertheless, the Jedi learns to let go of his fear as well as to keep rising up from the Origin Tree.
Kestis finds that the Bogano Vault could be unlocked by an astrium from the Tomb of Kujet on Dathomir. However, the Jedi is accosted by the nightsister Merrin and the mad Jedi Taron Malicos on Dathomir. Eventually arriving at Kujet's tomb, Kestis is overwhelmed by regret and anger over his past and loses control, destroying his master's lightsaber.      Survivors of Sith purges accept and let go of their past suffering, moving on to rise and work to restore their kind with respect to choice and the trust in the Force.  
After building a new lightsaber on Imperial Ilum, which now houses a world-wide artificial trench, Cal Kestis returns to Dathomir, where he and Merrin realize that they were both survivors who shared a similar past of loss and aim to restore their kind. They thus join forces, allowing the intricate Force of Dathomir to consume the fallen Taron Malicos.
While Merrin expresses her concern that recruiting the children of the Force would instead endanger the potential Jedi, Kestis presses on his quest for the holocron at Bogano as the Empire approaches. While Kestis overpowers the Second Sister, the echo of her past and suffering overwhelms Kestis, allowing the Inquisitor to steal Eno Cordova's holocron for the Empire.
Cal Kestis and Cere Junda discuss the Second Sister's past, with Junda accepting the pain of the past, letting go and willing to move on. Kestis is knighted, and together, the two Jedi storm the Fortress Inquisitorius on Nur to recover Eno Cordova's holocron. The Second Sister dies, though not before she sees pass her hate for Junda's failure regarding Padawans, instead desiring her kind to be avenged. Kestis and Junda barely escape the facility with their lives and the holocron, and back aboard the Stinger Mantis, Kestis destroys the holocron; the Jedi chooses to let go of forging the destinies of children, instead letting their destinies lie before the will of the Force.

Hera Syndulla attacks the Imperial blockade over Lothal with twenty-four T-65B X-wing starfighters, attempting to raid Lotha's TIE Defender assembly line. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn's blockade shoots down all of the rebel fighters.
Grand Moff Tarkin informs Thrawn that his TIE Defender program has been halted in favor of Krennic's Project Stardust. Considering that the loss of his TIE Defender program would outweigh the loss of Hera Syndulla, Thrawn leaves Lothal to the incompetence of Governor Pryce to plead his case to Emperor Palpatine.
Thrawn agrees to handle a gralloc problem for Krennic's Project Stardust in return for the continuation of funding for the TIE Defender program. While handling the gralloc infestation, Thrawn and the Chimaera traces a missing freighter to find that it had been raided by the Grysks. While battling a Grysk warship at the scene, the Chimaera is joined by Chiss Ascendancy forces led by Admiral Ar'alani. Thrawn reunites with the Chiss as well as Eli Vanto.
From the remains of the battle, Thrawn finds Un'hee, a Chiss girl who was kidnapped by the Grysk for her Force-sensitivity and was forced to serve as a navigator. Eli Vanto finds that many of the missing Imperial transports carried foodstuff which is used to feed Wookiee prisoners working on Project Stardust. They deduce that Imperial Governor Haveland had purposely arranged for similar disappearances as part of Project Stardust. To be rid of Brierly Ronan, a troublesome Imperial officer, Thrawn sends him and Vanto investigate Haveland's Aloxor system.      Thrawn's friend, Eli Vanto, serving under Admiral Ar'alani of the Chiss Ascendancy.  
Dayja Collerand, sent by the Security Bureau's Colonel Yularen, joins Vanto on Aloxor. Processing gathered intelligence, Thrawn deduces that Grand Admiral Balanhai Savit was responsible for stealing supplies from Project Stardust in the guise of grolloc infestations. When confronted, Savit explains that he did so because he believed that Stardust was a waste of resources, and that he hoped to funnel the stolen supplies to aid the Imperial Starfleet.
Grand Admirals Thrawn and Savit thus commit their forces in a non-lethal battle. Savit is defeated and captured by the Chimaera, Collerand, Ronan, Captain Boulag of the Firedrake, and Captain Gilad Pellaeon of the Harbinger. With the help of Thrawn's TIE Defenders, the Chiss defeat the Grysks.

With the former Jedi's guidance under the eyes of Morai, he then lets go of his master as Tano did hers, resisting the temptation to prevent Kanan Jarrus' death and thus Darth Sidious and the dark side of the Force. Parting ways with Tano, Bridger returns from the mystical realm and rejoins the Spectres.
Ronan gives an unfavorable report of Thrawn to Governor Tarkin, and Project Stardust becomes the sole recipient of funding over the TIE Defender program until Stardust is completed. Before such point, Vader is assigned to protect Stardust. Having received news that the situation on Lothal is "critical," Thrawn returns to the world with the escort of Captain Pellaeon aboard the Harbinger. Before leaving for Lothal, Thrawn takes the gamble of convincing Ronan to travel with Ar'alani back to the Chiss Ascendancy despite Ar'alani's warning that growing chaos amongst the Chiss threatened civil war. Thrawn also recommends Commander Faro to take command the Eleventh Fleet.
With Thrawn's loyalty to the Empire in serious doubt, the Emperor orders him to return for a long talk after handling the rebellion on Lothal. Palpatine also tells Thrawn to reconstruct a part of the Lothal Jedi Temple within the Chimaera to tempt Ezra Bridger, and further instructs the Chiss to persuade Bridger to join him.
     Ezra Bridger accepts the passing of his parents and mentor, who sacrificed themselves to save the ones they loved. Thus resisting darkness and foiling the plans of the Sith, Bridger later does likewise for his new-found family.

Recalling his experience of being enslaved by Trandoshan hunters alongside other Wookiees, Chewbacca frees the enslaved miners on Andelm IV.
While Chewbacca and Zarro are captured by Imperials, the latter are misled into thinking that Jaum is a member of the Rebellion and no longer desire to expand their reach to Andelm IV. After making their escape, Chewbacca and Zarro part ways on Andelm IV, though not before the Wookiee gives Zarro the medal he himself earned at the Battle of Yavin.
With his A-wing repaired, Chewbacca proceeds to Kashyyyk to return the bandolier of a fallen Wookiee before leaving with the Millennium Falcon.
Several weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker is involved in a Skirmish over Llanic. He then undertakes a mission to Rodia and a mission to Fex. After a mission on Denon, Skywalker and Nakari Kelen go on a mission to Pasher.
Han Solo and Chewbacca take a step back from the rebel cause and return to smuggling. However, when given an offer too good to refuse by Leia Organa, Solo agrees to rescue Alliance intelligence chief Airen Cracken's rebel spies—a network of informants assembled in the span of years with only one objective who, after completing that objective one month ago, began to be murdered by a traitor.      Han Solo and Leia Organa rekindled their relationship after Solo chose to serve the Rebellion, albeit with flair and arrogance, instead of living dishonestly as a smuggler doing odd jobs.  
For the mission, Solo is to rescue the spies and capture the traitor while under the guise of competing in the Dragon Void race with the Millennium Falcon. With all of the spies aboard the Falcon, Solo competes in the race, though it is attacked by Imperial forces. Nevertheless, the Falcon perseveres, and its rebel crew discover the mole amongst them and detain the brainwashed traitor. While he could have gone through the race's endpoint—a gate that created a wormhole leading to the race's starting point—Solo instead allows Loo Re Anno, the last of her kind, to return home using the gate, which was created by Anno's kind for their exodus from the wider galaxy.
Returning Han Solo's favor, Anno leads her people from between the seams of time and space to attack the Imperials pursuing the Dragon Void racers, allowing the latter to escape. Anno's people intends their return to be the last; before they leave the world forever.
Having accomplished his mission, Solo returns to the Rebellion and realizes that he could not lie to himself and deny reality any longer; that he had to decide who he really is and what is worth living for.

They discover murals of High Republic iconography warning that when used independently, one ring would grant eternal life at the cost of the user's madness, while another would grant fortune at the cost of hastening the user's eventual demise.
With the assistance of Just Lucky, Tagge's mercenaries trace Aphra's crew to Vaale, taking the Ring of Fortune before destroying the city of living bone with Aphra and her crew captured. Aphra's crew is taken to Ronen Tagge's Private Penthouse in Canto Bight, where they defeat Ronen, who was wearing the two rings, and escape from after stealing several priceless artifacts.      A replica of the Nihil Path engine set both the Unbroken Clan and the Tagge dynasty in pursuit; while the clan was reputed for not letting go, Tagge hired the rogue archaeologist Doctor Aphra for the hunt.  
Nakano Lash resurfaces near Kessel. Having been informed by Aphra and Black Krrsantan on Burnin Konn that she has resurfaced, Bossk races to find Lash. The latter is also sought by her former protégé, Beilert Valance, as well as Boba Fett, who deviated from delivering Han Solo in carbonite to settle a personal score with Lash. Lash had torn apart the group of hunters years ago on Corellia, when she killed their client and the sole heir of the Mourner's Wail Syndicate, Khamus, as well as causing the death of Krynthia, the sole heir of the Unbroken Clan, instigating a continuation of violence between the two groups, which formed the three crime syndicates of Corellia with the addition of Lady Proxima's White Worms.
Leaving her lover, Losha, and her peaceful life on the Moon of Logal Ri behind, T'onga pursues Lash to avenge the death of her brother, T'ongor, while Thisspiasian hunter Ooris Bynar pursues Lash with the help of the bondsman Syphacc.

While the Liberty and Corona Squadron, previously at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three, did not join the rebels at Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine. Instead, Corona Squadron undertake a series of reconnaissance missions for the Rebellion, charting the planet D'Qar shortly before the Battle of Endor. D'Qar would house only a small Alliance outpost during the Galactic Civil War before becoming the base of the Resistance decades later.

After a duel of wills against the phantom Grand Inquisitor, who found himself tied to a fate worse than death as he is bound by Darth Vader to the mortal realm despite dying years ago over Mustafar, Skywalker asserts his understanding that the Jedi believed in self-sacrifice; compassion—dying for a greater cause.
Darth Vader and ZED-6-7 trail a transmitter from Padmé Amidala's apartment and travel to Vendaxa after being led to a false finding of Luke Skywalker.

Darth Vader and his droid finds the group's sole survivor: Sabé, a handmaiden of the late Padmé Amidala. Sabé's group intent on avenging Amidala's death, Vader tells the handmaiden that he as well sought revenge on those who hid the cause of Amidala's death, and Sabé joins Vader and leads him to Naboo, where she had hidden the security recordings taken from Amidala's apartment.
Now on a hunt for the truth of Padmé Amidala's death, Darth Vader comes across Sabé's associates, former Royal Naboo Security Forces guards of Amidala Captains Gregar Typho and Tonra, who long suspected the senator was murdered after leaving for Mustafar during the last moments of the Clone Wars. With their presumption that Darth Vader had killed Padmé Amidala and Anakin Skywalker confirmed by the Sith Lord himself, Sabé's group ambush him, though their confrontation is interrupted by an elder sando aqua monster.
Darth Vader slays the sando aqua monster after fleeing with ZED-6-7, thereby increasing the species' chances of extinction within a century to eighty-three percent. Vader then leads his death trooper unit to battle the Amidalans, who guarded the tomb of Padmé Amidala under the leadership of Ric Olié. With memories of the group's leader teaching Anakin Skywalker to operate Amidala's Royal Naboo Starship surfacing, Vader spares Olié and proceeds to Amidala's tomb, although he is stopped by Sabé and other handmaidens of the former Naboo Queen and senator. Unable to kill them, he immobilizes Padmé Amidala's bodyguards and enters her tomb.      Rejected by his son, the cyborg Vader struggled with his desire for power and his chosen destiny as a Jedi and current servitude to the Sith, tearing through his past only to be reminded of his losses.

Lash further reveals that she had been raising Khamus and Krynthia's child, Cadeliah, in the hope that she would unite the two warring syndicates as their joint heir.
While T'onga's lets go of her desire for vengeance, she is mortally wounded by Boba Fett, who fulfills his desire to arrange Lash's death by leaving her on her starship, which is destroyed by Vukorah of the Unbroken Clan. Fett escapes aboard the Slave I, and Valance vows to protect Cadeliah as per Lash's dying wish, taking his ship, the Broken Wing, alongside Cadeliah.

For wallowing in grief, Vader is deposited by Darth Sidious to the black sands of Mustafar, on the spot where the Sith apprentice was immolated decades prior. To turn Vader's anger back into fear and the fear into pain, Sidious sends Ochi of Bestoon, assassin of the Sith, as a reminder.
The Eye of Webbish Bog calls out to Vader, reminding the cyborg of his inner conflicts between his personal desire for power, his current servitude to the Sith and destined servitude to the Force, and his personal needs for family. After receiving a wayfinder to Exegol from the Eye, Vader defeats Ochi's droid army and departs Mustafar holding Ochi captive in an escape pod retrofitted onto his green Jedi starfighter.
Darth Vader and Ochi reach the vicinity of Exegol, where they fly through an Imperial blockade led by Administrator Sly Moore as well as a creature of a summa-verminoth sub-species. After receiving a vision of his son, Luke Skywalker, striking him down and taking his place at the Emperor's side, Vader makes a forbidden use of the Force to subdue the beast, thereby violating his master's command.

Lando Calrissian insisted on saving Lobot despite the latter's loss of mind and the lives of rebels being at stake.  
Starlight Squadron finds the ruins of the Sixth Division instead and is ambushed by Imperial probe droids. Amidst the chaos, Lobot begins to die in his efforts to keep the rebels' linguistics droid operational. While Lando Calrissian remains adamant in telling Lobot to cease maintaining the droid, Kes Dameron, fearing for his love, Shara Bey, demands Calrissian to let Lobot die in exchange so that Bey may be saved.
Calrissian is detained by order of Leia Organa. After secretly learning its language, C-3PO deactivates the Rebellion's linguistics droid in its refusal to yield its self-interest to save Lobot. With command of the droid's language, communications are reestablished with Starlight Squadron, which escapes from Zahra and her flagship, Tarkin's Will, by exploiting the Empire's disregard for its own droids.
However, Shara Bey, Starlight's commanding officer, is captured by Zahra's forces.

Although he fails, the Sith Lord rescues Sabé, who chooses to join him and leave her sisterhood.
Sabé finds a diplomatic solution; she unveils to the Skakoan refugees Jul Tambor's true colors as a power-hungry individual willing to sacrifice his own people—he has ordered his forces to bomb a city despite being informed that his people were present there along with Vader, discrediting Tambor.

Starros' crew and Kho Phon Farrus help Doctor Aphra expel the Spark Eternal from her body near the Fermata Cage. Starros successfully forces the "hopelessly emotionally constipated" Aphra and Magna Tolvan to have a real conversation, and the crew part ways afterward.

Luke Skywalker is similarly affected, with his powers intermittently augmented uncontrollably or weakened. Nevertheless, with his help, the rebels recover much of the Kezarat Colony, who give their fuel to the Rebel Fleet, though some of its population decides to remain in No-Space and colonize the former Great Hall of the Nihil.

Leia Organa travels to Ord Mantell to find Maz Kanata for assistance in rescuing Han Solo. Boushh attacks Organa, though the bounty hunter was defeated by the latter, who took from Kanata's teachings of patience. Organa wears Boushh's armor as a disguise, thanking Maz Kanata before leaving in the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca and R2-D2.

Mon Mothma orders members of Rebel High Command to convene on Zastiga. Aboard the Mellcrawler, Nien Nunb transports Leia Organa, Caluan Ematt, and C-3PO to Zastiga, where they join Luke Skywalker and R2-D2.      Barely recovering from their defeat at Hoth, the Rebellion was forced to face the Empire's new Death Star.  
On Zastiga, while Mon Mothma, Gial Ackbar, Airen Cracken, Crix Madine, Leia Organa, Carlist Rieekan, and a number of top admirals and generals—amongst them Nantz and Massa, as well as Veertag and Tantor—meet at a safe house to discuss the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker, Wedge Antilles, and Nien Nunb meet for a discussion of how Nunb saved Antilles at Hagar Secundus.
Luke Skywalker, who had rejected Antilles' offer for him to rejoin Red Squadron and had been delaying his return to Yoda on Dagobah to await news of Han Solo, expects that he would return to the Redemption. Skywalker also tells Leia Organa of his need to master patience to become a Jedi.
The next day, taking from Skywalker's lesson, Organa proposes Operation Yellow Moon to buy much-needed time for the Rebellion and the galaxy at the risk of her life. Mon Mothma approves of the proposal after telling Organa not to deny herself another chance at love; duty cannot provide the comfort love would bring.
Rebels leave Zastiga the following day.
Operation Yellow Moon; Aboard Nien Nunb's Mellcrawler, Leia Organa leads a faux Alliance recruiting mission in the Corva sector, nearly a hundred-thousand light years away from the second Death Star, that is meant to distract the Empire while the Rebellion gathers an armada at Sullust.
Imperials led by Captain Khione garrison Basteel and Sesid in retaliation for Organa attempting to recruit for the Alliance on the two worlds, imposing greater fear and oppression on their populace in the goal of instilling absolute obedience.
Unwilling to cause more lives of others to be lost while doing their duty for the fate of the Rebellion and the galaxy, Organa's crew decide to go beyong their mission parameters and assist in a civilian uprising against the Empire on Jaresh, ensuring that the local resistance succeeds.
Organa's crew proceed to the Yellow Moon, over which rebel recruits from the Corva sector are set to rendezvous as arranged by the Rebel Alliance. The Mellcrawler broadcasts a message to the gathered rebels that they are only a distraction for a major upcoming Alliance battle elsewhere, and telling them to flee. As the rebels leave, Captain Khione's Imperial flagship, the Shieldmaiden, arrives and captures the Mellcrawler.      Operation Yellow Moon taught that while duty was crucial, people struggled against the Empire for inter-personal love; whether to honor those who died in the conflict or to fight for a brighter future for those still living.  
With the individual voluntary sacrifices of two members of Organa's crew, as well as a surprise return of the rebel recruits, the crew destroys the Shieldmaiden using the Mellcrawler as a bomb, escaping Khione's Star Destroyer with a stolen Imperial shuttle named Tydirium.
Aboard the shuttle Tydirium, Leia Organa, Nien Nunb, and Kidi Aleri reach Kothlis, where they join Luke Skywalker. Skywalker reports that they had gathered that Han Solo is still in carbonite, held at Jabba's Palace.

With his green-bladed lightsaber, Luke Skywalker leads a raid at Imperial Refining Platform M36 to secure an entire year's worth of fuel supplies for the Rebel Alliance. With the rebels skeptical of Skywalker for his Force abilities sometimes giving false positives of potential threats, the rebels refuse to heed Skywalker's call to risk jumping into hyperspace and are attacked by an Imperial Star Destroyer as a result. Skywalker resists Darth Sidious' telepathic urges to abandon the rebels for being weak and the temptation to leave the war to live a quiet life, rejoining the rebels aboard their transport. Controlling his anger that festered from his guilt of nearly abandoning the rebels, Skywalker assists their leader in helping the rebels escape to safety.

Realizing his own fear and anger, Luke Skywalker throws away his lightsaber and refuses to kill Vader. While Sidious attempts to destroy the Jedi, Darth Vader's compassion for his son overwhelms him, and, resuming his duty to the Force as the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker kills his former Sith Master at the cost of his own life. By destroying the Sith, Anakin brings balance to the Force and passes away in peace, and Luke Skywalker escapes from the Death Star as a true Jedi.

Behind the scenes

"[W]e're exploring a lot of different storylines. This really spawns from what George Lucas said years ago, that he created Star Wars to move forward and backward along a mythological timeline."
―Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy
Star Wars creator George Lucas had intended the fictional universe to be a mythology, with stories taking place throughout a timeline. Since 2014, Lucasfilm has been creatively aligning all storytelling in the current canon, aiming to keep all content consistent and interconnected in all aspects. Some content draw inspiration from the Expanded Universe that is now branded as a separate continuity—Star Wars Legends—which has its own timeline of galactic history on Wookieepedia, an unaffiliated online Star Wars encyclopedia maintained by volunteers.
Lucasfilm's Star Wars eras for the current canon continuity comprise of "Dawn of the Jedi," "The Old Republic," "The High Republic," "Fall of the Jedi," "Reign of the Empire," "Age of Rebellion," "The New Republic," "Rise of the First Order," and "New Jedi Order."
