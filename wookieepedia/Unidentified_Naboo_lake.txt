This lake in Naboo's Lake Country was where Varykino, home of the celebrated poet Omar Berenko and later the Naberrie family, was located. Convergence, the ancestral home of House Palpatine, was built at the end of a vast stretch of meadow near the shore, at some distance from Varykino, and one of its verandas offered a view of the lake.
According to Padmé Amidala, when she was in Level Three, the class used Varikyno as a school retreat, and the children would often swim to a small island across the lake.

Behind the scenes
The lake filmed in Episode II is Lake Como in Italy. The Varykino scenes were filmed at the Villa del Balbianello overlooking the lake.
