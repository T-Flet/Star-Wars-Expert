Power Station was a location in Mos Eisley on Tatooine where citizens could come to power their speeders, droids or equipment. It was a place where the common people of Mos Eisley came to chat before or after their work. The station was run by the uninterested power droid 4-LB. It charged 15 credits to power a speeder and 3 to 4 credits to power a droid.
During the hunt for Adar Tallon, 4-LB passed information to a team of undercover Alliance operatives about an individual matching Tallon's description. The information was the location of Lank's farm, but the droid had confused Tallon with the actual owner, Bels Lank. Once the Alliance team had left, the assassin droid IG-72—who had been eavesdropping on the conversation—trashed both the power station and 4-LB.
