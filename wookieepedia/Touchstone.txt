Touchstones were small treats, made in various shapes, colors, sizes, textures, even temperatures. They could be placed into the mouth, to dissolve into flavors, or broken under the nose and inhaled. Some contained flower scent, vanilla syrup or cinnamon-flavored liqueur, found in star-, triangle- or sphere-shaped variations.
Jerec was fond of them, not only for himself but also of giving bad-tasting ones to his subordinates, who he knew were too proud to refuse him.
One time he offered one to Sariss which released a stench, causing Boc Aseca to laugh at her.
