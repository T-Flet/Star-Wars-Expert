"What difference does it make now? The Separatists know we're involved.""I don't disagree with you Anakin, but to send in Republic gunships defeats our purpose."
―Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi debate the Onderonian Civil War
A gunship was a class of vessel used by military forces. Usually equipped with heavy armament and mainly used for offensive operations, several models of gunship could also fill the role of a troop transport. During the Clone Wars, the Republic's army often made use of the Low Altitude Assault Transport, also named the Republic attack gunship. Its lightly armed cousin, the LAAT/le patrol gunship, was used as a patrol craft for police forces on Coruscant and other worlds. The Auzituck anti-slaver gunship was manufactured by the Wookiees of Kashyyyk to fight off enslavers that frequently attacked their world. The Razor Crest was a pre-Empire era military patrol gunship that was owned by Mandalorian bounty hunter, Din Djarin.
