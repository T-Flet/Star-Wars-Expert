"They say it lives in there. They say it sleeps. It lives in an abandoned sarlacc pit.""Lived on Tatooine my whole life. There's no such thing as an abandoned sarlacc pit.""There is if you eat the sarlacc."
â€•Din Djarin and Cobb Vanth regarding the abandoned sarlacc pit
An abandoned sarlacc pit on Tatooine was inhabited by a krayt dragon, which the Mandalorian Din Djarin speculated to have eaten the sarlacc. Members of a tribe of Tusken Raiders regularly visited the pit to feed the dragon, in hopes that it would sleep longer. The pit was eventually the site of an effort between Djarin, Cobb Vanth, the citizens of Mos Pelgo, and the tribe of Tusken Raiders to eliminate the krayt dragon living inside the pit.
