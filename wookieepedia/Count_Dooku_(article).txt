Count Dooku is an overview of the life of Count Dooku, also known as Sith Lord Darth Tyranus. It was written by Daniel Wallace and published in Star Wars Insider 113. It started with Dooku's origins as a youngling in the Jedi Temple under the tutelage of Yoda, his apprenticeship to Jedi Master Thame Cerulian then his choosing of Qui-Gon Jinn as his own padawan. When Jinn was killed by a Sith on Naboo, Dooku resigned from the Jedi Order and was contacted by Darth Sidious, who later gave him the title Darth Tyranus when Dooku joined the Sith. The article continues with his creation of the clone army using Jango Fett's genome, his command of the Confederacy of Independent Systems against the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, and his death at the hands of Anakin Skywalker during the battle of Coruscant.
