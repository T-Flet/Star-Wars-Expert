The Rebel officer corps was the officer corps of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. As an officer corps, it consisted of Alliance officers, as well as several T-series tactical droids, despite that they were built during the Clone Wars. The Rebel officer corps had relatively few valuable candidates, as academic institutions operated by the Alliance were small in number.
