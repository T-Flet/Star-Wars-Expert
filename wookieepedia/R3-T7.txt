R3-T7 was an R3-series astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton. He became an independent operator after losing his owner, but roamed the upper levels of Galactic City on the ecumenopolis Coruscant, forever searching for his master. In 22 BBY, R3-T7 was malfunctioning and blast-scorched as he rolled through a crowded street on Coruscant that passed by an alley containing a side entrance in to the Outlander Club, a nightclub in the Uscru Entertainment District.
As droid passed by the entrance to the alley, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker emerged from the club with the bounty hunter Zam Wesell and began to interrogate her. Standing 1.09 meters tall, R3-T7 was an R-series astromech droid with green, white, and yellow paneling, a clear dome, and a black sensor.

Behind the scenes
R3-T7 appeared in the film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones, which was released on May 16, 2002. In the current Star Wars canon, the droid was first identified in the Star Wars: R2-D2 Deluxe Book and Model Set, a 2016 model set with an accompanying reference book written by Michael Kogge.
In the Star Wars Legends continuity, R3-T7 was revealed prior to the release of the film as a preview action figure in the Star Wars: Power of the Jedi line produced by Hasbro Inc.
