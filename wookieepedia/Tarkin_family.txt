"A Tarkin looks their enemy in the eye and puts their blade in their throat."
―Wilhuff Tarkin
The Tarkin family, or Tarkin clan, was a human family that hailed from Eriadu, a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy. Among Eriadu's first pioneers, the Tarkins led the colonists, helping them fight back the planet's wilderness. Progressively, the Tarkin militias evolved into a proper sector military, which became the Outland Regions Security Force in which many Tarkins served. By the last decades of the Galactic Republic, the Tarkin family was immensely wealthy and influential. The Tarkins adopted a martial tradition when the militias were reorganized. The family owned the planet Eadu, which Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin later gave to the Galactic Empire. The Espirion Saan claimed that Wilhuff had a brother named Gideon, whom Wilhuff left for dead during a survey on Eadu.
