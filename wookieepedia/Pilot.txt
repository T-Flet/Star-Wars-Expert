―Senator Mon Mothma, to Hera Syndulla
     Luke Skywalker, Garven Dreis, and Biggs Darklighter were all accomplished pilots serving in the Alliance to Restore the Republic's Starfighter Corps.  
A pilot, sometimes called a starpilot or flyboy, directly controlled the operation of a vehicle while located within the same craft. For small starships the pilot might have been in charge of all aspects of the vehicle including navigation, sensors, communications, and weapons. For larger ships, a pilot may have been assisted by other crew members to handle different ship systems. The term "pilot" applied across vehicles used on land or in water, air, and/or space.
Combat pilots would either need to move together or singly during starfighter combat. According to the Chiss Thrawn, pilots in a battle, like soldiers on a battlefield, saw victory differently from others in battle. Thrawn stated this was because to a pilot or soldier on the line, victory was surviving the battle they were currently involved in.
During the reign of the Galactic Empire, piloting without a valid license was a criminal offense; among the crimes listed on an Aurebesh wanted poster for Kanan Jarrus was "piloting without license".
Some pilots could be spacers.
Bloodburn was a rare disease that affected pilots.
