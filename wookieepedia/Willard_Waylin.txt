"Sergeant Waylin, Chief Mechanic and head of the hangar crew."
â€•Willard Waylin
Willard Waylin was a human who served as a mechanic in the navy of the Galactic Empire. After graduating Arkanis Academy, Waylin found his fascination with Imperial design and eidetic memory made him an unparalleled mechanic. All this in spite of his inability to see the appeal in flying a starfighter himself. Following the Battle of Endor, Waylin served as the chief mechanic aboard the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Overseer.
