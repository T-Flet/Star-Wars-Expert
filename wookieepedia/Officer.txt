"Clear the bridge. Escort the officers down to the hangar."
―Poe Dameron
An officer in the armed forces, or commissioned officer, was an individual who held military authority. Other types of military officers included warrant officers and non-commissioned officers. Commissioned officers could be divided between junior officers of lower rank, and senior officers of a higher rank. Republic officers were command military personnel who served the armed forces of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, while Separatist officers were command military personnel who served the Confederacy of Independent Systems armed forces. Imperial officers were command military personnel of the Imperial Military. In the Chiss Ascendancy, Chiss officers served in the Ascendancy military.
All military organizations depended on officers to effectively function. Non-commissioned officers would work with line infantry, while generals would create strategies and tactics.
