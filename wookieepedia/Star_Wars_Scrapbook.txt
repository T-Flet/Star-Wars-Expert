This article is about Star Wars comic strip feature.Â You may be looking for the Star Wars Scrapbook: The Essential Collection book.
     
The Star Wars Scrapbook was a section within the Star Wars comic strip. It usually occupied the second panel of the strip, and only appeared in the Sunday strips, starting with the story arc Darth Vader Strikes, taking a brief hiatus with Iceworld only to return in Revenge of the Jedi.
These panels depict many Star Wars characters, vehicles, creatures, and locations that were known at the time of the original trilogy. They were meant to be disposable, so that newspapers that laid out their Sunday comics in an alternate format could exclude them without those readers missing any of the story.
