"You've been working on that thing for years.""It's never gonna run."
―Amee and Melee, referring to Anakin Skywalker's podracer —  Listen (file info)
Amee was a human girl who was born on the planet Tatooine in around 38 BBY. She was a close friend of the slave Anakin Skywalker and spent time socialising with him and his friends Wald and Kitster Banai. In 32 BBY, when Amee was six, the trio visited Skywalker in Slave Quarters Row with the children Seek and Melee. Skywalker, who was working on his podracer in a courtyard, informed them all that he would be taking part in the Boonta Eve Classic podrace the next day.
The other children were dubious about Skywalker's chances in the race, and Amee doubtfully pointed out that he had been working on the vehicle for years. Seek then suggested they all go play a ball game, and Amee left the courtyard with him, Wald and Melee, giggling as they went. Skywalker went on to win the podrace and leave Tatooine. Amee was the only member of her friend group to wear braces, and also wore a brown dress. She had blonde hair, and fair skin.

Behind the scenes
Amee was played by Katie Lucas, daughter of director George Lucas, in the 1999 prequel trilogy film, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. Katie was credited under the pseudonym "Jenna Green". In the script, Amee also says Melee's only line of dialogue which is also incorrectly attributed to her in the 2017 reference book Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy from A - Z.
