The Republic was a cruiser in the New Republic.

History
The Millennium Falcon was docked on the stern of the vessel, near the engines. Han Solo communicated with several freighters from the ship, clearing them to join with the fleet.
The Republic served as a temporary command ship for Mon Mothma after the loss of the Nespis VIII spaceport. Most of the prominent leaders of the New Republic military were present at a meeting there, where the future strategies against Emperor Palpatine were discussed.
