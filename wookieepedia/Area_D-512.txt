"While patrolling Area D-512, we spotted a group of unidentified flying starships. [...] We've renamed Quadrant IV Area D-512 to the "Penumbra Omen Quadrant" to further warn our new recruits."
â€•Captain Silverline
     The Penumbra Omen Quadrant  
Area D-512 was a quadrant of space in the Naboo system. Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, during the Galactic Civil War, an unit of the Imperial Navy commanded by Captain Silverline, Imperial Authoritarian, was ambushed in the Area D-512 and suffered heavy casualties. This unidentified hostile force, possibly made of droids, was code-named Penumbra Omen by the Imperial Navy. Due to the presence of these unknown incredibly-dangerous starships, all travel in the area was prohibited by the Empire and the quadrant was renamed Penumbra Omen Quadrant. Captain Silverline's emergency report was later intercepted by Fghai'g Windrunner, a pilot of the Royal Naboo Security Forces who considered to explore the Penumbra Omen quadrant.
