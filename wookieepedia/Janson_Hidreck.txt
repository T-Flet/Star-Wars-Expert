"A single freighter managed to overwhelm four of your TIE fighters? Just what kind of operation are you running there, Spiftz?"
â€•Janson Hidreck, to Branwayne Spiftz
Janson Hidreck was a human female who held the rank of commander in the First Order. When Branwayne Spiftz, who had taken a mission to search for a supposed weapon on Minfar, came across retaliation from the Resistance, Hidreck and her Star Destroyer were sent to assist. However, by the time that Hidreck arrived, Spiftz's light cruiser, the Ladara Vex, had been destroyed by the Resistance, and her Star Destroyer was ambushed and destroyed by a fleet of Resistance starships.
