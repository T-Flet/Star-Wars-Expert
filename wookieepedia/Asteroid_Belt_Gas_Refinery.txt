The Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery was a Clouzon-36 processing refinery owned and maintained by the Mining Guild. During the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire, the Spectres raided the facility to steal fuel for Phoenix Cell, blowing it up with the assistance of a pod of purrgil, spacefaring creatures who fed on Clouzon-36 gas.
