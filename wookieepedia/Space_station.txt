"That's no moon. It's a space station."
―Obi-Wan Kenobi, upon seeing the Death Star —  Listen (file info)
     The space station known as the Death Star  
Space stations were artificial structures in space. Some, like the Citadel of Rur and Faos Station, were stationed independently in deep space or even in nebulas. Most stations[source?] were capable of being in orbit of astronomical objects, such as the Sorca Retreat.
Stations commissioned for military use often had emplacements of defensive mechanisms consisting of technologies like turbolaser batteries. Some stations could mobilize and navigate through both realspace and hyperspace.
The DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station and DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station were constructed by the command of Darth Sidious, publicly known as the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and later Emperor of the Galactic Empire. The two Death Stars were also classified as battle stations, a type of space station.
During or after 34 ABY, the Safari droid M1-RE, a specialized member of the Galactic Society of Creature Enthusiasts, was stationed on the Youngling Care Space Station where she cared for and studied several species of younglings. The station was very large and had several rooms, including one that was designed to resemble the Forest Moon of Endor.
