The Imperial Sourcebook, by Greg Gorden, was a West End Games supplement for their version of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game.

It was designed to be an in-universe report on the Empire compiled for Mon Mothma by Arhul Hextrophon.
The Imperial Sourcebook "is set in that turbulent time that begins with the destruction of the first Death Star" and "looks at the might of the Empire after Star Wars IV: A New Hope."
