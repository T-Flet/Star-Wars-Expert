"Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious."
―Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Luke Skywalker
Mos Eisley (pronounced /mɑs aɪzliː/, moss izelee, (Listen (help·info))) was a large spaceport settlement on the planet Tatooine.

Description
     Mos Eisley as seen from the Junland Wastes  
Mos Eisley was a spaceport on the desert planet of Tatooine home to various species of aliens from throughout the galaxy. It was located in a broad valley in the Great Mesra Plateau, north of Anchorhead and southeast of the Jundland Wastes. The spaceport, while lacking a primary landing facility, contained 362 hangars in which arrivals could berth. The city was roughly divided into the Old Quarter, which was laid out like a wheel surrounding the water distribution plant, and the new city center adjacent to the Mos Eisley prefecture militia base. On the far side of the city was Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina and the "Community" junk yard.

     The Ubrikkian Trade Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Mos Eisley  
The Old Quarter was roughly defined by Outer Curved Street and Inner Curved Street, and included Spacers Row and Paradise Road. Besides the water and power distribution plants around which it was arranged, the Quarter was filled with small landing bays, stores and the city market, while in later years various off-world corporations contributed to its gentrification by constructing larger buildings including the Ubrikkian Trade Tower and the Quebe-Luxfause Systems headquarters. The city's prefecture and Spaceport Traffic Control offices were also located there, as was the Customs House. An ancient colony ship, the Dowager Queen lay crashed by Dune Street and was maintained as a monument.
Upwards from Kerner Plaza and towards the far end of Straight Street was the new city center, which was marked by newer buildings including the Imperial prefecture base and a Dim-U monastery. This area of Mos Eisley was dominated by hotels, casinos and tall complexes built by off-world companies.

History
     Jabba the Hutt established a sizable presence in the city after moving there from Mos Espa  
Some time after the Separatist Crisis podracing fell out of favor, leading many gangsters and criminals to abandon the sport's capital in the north of Tatooine, Mos Espa and seek out new prosperous grounds for exploitation. Many of them, including influential Hutt criminal Jabba Desilijic Tiure made their way to Mos Eisley, bringing a breath of fresh air to the city. By the time of the Imperial Era, Mos Espa had become a relatively wealthy town, attracting scum and villainy from around the planet and beyond. Jabba even had an expansive townshouse complex| built in the city's historic center and maintained a private box in the town's Felvath Kurs Arena. The Desilijic crime family had established a strong presence in the town, with Jabba's personal cook Porcellus working as the head chef on the exotic restaurant Court of the Fountain. Jabba and his empire's presence caught the attention of off-world businesses including Ubrikkian Industries and Quebe-Luxfause Systems, both of which constructed high-rise buildings in the old city center, leading to the gentrification of the once-rundown neighborhood.
With the Millennium Falcon parked in Docking Bay 94, Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina was where Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi met Han Solo and Chewbacca, during their attempts to reach Alderaan and deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. Imperial stormtroopers also searched Mos Eisley for R2-D2 and C-3PO, the holders of the missing Death Star plans. The cantina was also home to the infamous confrontation between Han Solo and Greedo, which led to Greedo's untimely death. Ponda Baba and Dr. Cornelius Evazan were present at Mos Eisley, and Obi-Wan Kenobi cut off Ponda Baba's right arm with his lightsaber. Shortly afterward, Kenobi and Skywalker were confronted by a stormtrooper, whom the Jedi killed. The group escaped from Mos Eisley in the Falcon after a shootout with stormtroopers.

     Celebrations for the destruction of the second Death Star in Outer Curved Street  
When Boba Fett was hired by Darth Vader to find information on the pilot who destroyed the Death Star, he discovered that the boy had escaped Mos Eisley on Han Solo's ship along with Kenobi. Not knowing the latter, he interrogated a gang of Rodians, who informed him of the location of Kenobi's home in the Dune Sea. To learn the name of the pilot, Fett went to Chalmun's cantina knowing that Han Solo had frequented it. There, he learned of Skywalker's name from a young moisture farmer, and went in search of him, encountering him in the home of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The city celebrated the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of the Emperor. Boba Fett visited the city to meet with a Pyke boss in the Desert Survey Office.

In 9 ABY, the bounty hunter Din Djarin arrived in Mos Eisley looking for repairs to his ship, the Razor Crest, and took a job with Toro Calican to hunt Fennec Shand. Toro shot her and left her for dead on the sands of Tatooine. Shortly after, Boba Fett found her, and took her to a mod-parlor, where a modifier saved her life.
Djarin later returned to Mos Eisley in in search of a Mandalorian to help him, and proceeded to Mos Pelgo, where he met Cobb Vanth. He later returned to the city, and was introduced to "Frog Lady" by Peli, who said she might know where to find Mandalorians. After the destruction of the Razor Crest, Djarin returned to Peli again, and she helped him to modify an N-1 starfighter.
During the Battle for Mos Espa, Fennec Shand assassinated the Pyke Boss and his partners in the Desert Survey Office in the outskirts of the town.

Government

During the Imperial Era, Mos Eisley was ruled as a prefecture, under an Imperial prefect who had an office guarded by stormtroopers in the Old Quarter. The local militia base acted as a garrison, guarding the city, maintaining foot patrols and establishing checkpoints.
