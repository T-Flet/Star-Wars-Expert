The Battle of Naboo expansion 140-card pack of the Young Jedi Collectible Card Game was produced by Decipher, Inc. and released on April 5, 2000. It was based around Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, specifically elements relating to the Battle of Naboo. Most of the cards are colored green, the color assigned to the planet of Naboo, and had elements related to the third act of the movie. Darth Maul's lightsaber, the double-bladed version, made its appearance here. The player drew two destiny cards for this weapon, and it was considered to be the ultimate weapon in the game.
