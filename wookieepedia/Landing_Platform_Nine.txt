Landing Platform Nine, also known as landing pad nine or platform 9, was the ninth landing pad at the Imperial Center of Military Research on Scarif. Prior to the Battle of Scarif, the stolen Zeta-class Heavy Cargo Shuttle SW-0608 piloted by the rebel squad "Rogue One" landed on landing pad nine.
An Imperial inspection team arrived via the tram and headed inside the cargo shuttle, only to find that there were hidden rebels, and was ambushed and killed. Then, a shoretrooper threw a fragmentation grenade inside the cargo shuttle, destroying the entire vehicle and creating extensive damage to the landing pad.
