The Death Star II Limited set is the eighth full expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, a card game based on the Star Wars universe. It consists of 182 cards (91 Dark Side and 91 Light Side cards) and was introduced in July of 2000. This set consists of 2 ultra-rare, 2 exclusive rare, 78 rare, 50 uncommon, and 50 common cards. This set introduced many of the classic characters from Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi that were involved with the events surrounding the Death Star II and the Battle of Endor. This set included many powerful cards and introduced ultra-rares: Luke Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine. It also introduced the Mon Calamari Star Cruiser, RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, TIE/IN interceptor, and many other starships and other important elements to the game. This expansion was noted for introducing the Final Jedi Test to the game. A complete list of the Death Star II Limited set can be found on the players committee's page.
Because this is an expansion set, each card has an expansion-set symbol, in this case force lightning, which is located near the top right corner of the card.
This set was sold in 11-card expansion packs and 30-pack expansion boxes. Each pack includes one rare (or ultra rare) card, three uncommon cards and seven common cards. Starter decks were also produced for this set. In the starter decks, exclusive rares were introduced: Admiral Ackbar and Admiral Firmus Piett.

Continuity
This set was the original source for the names of many characters from Episode VI, mostly the pilots and crew of starfighters and starships participating in the Battle of Endor. Notable new characters include Chiraneau, Karie Neth, Panno, Keir Santage, Sarkli, Telsij, Verrack, and unnamed Imperial advisors Janus Greejatus and Sim Aloo.
The names of a number of existing Legends characters were first applied to characters seen on screen, including Tycho Celchu, Soontir Fel, Airen Cracken, Horton Salm, Turr Phennir, and Walex Blissex. The card of new Royal Guard character Myn Kyneugh indicates he once instructed Legends characters Kir Kanos and Carnor Jax.
