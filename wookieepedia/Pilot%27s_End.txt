"Nearby you'll find lots of hazards that wary spacers have given nicknames: the Maw, the Black Pits, Pilots' End, and other perils."
―Midnight's book
Pilot's End was a navigational hazard in the Akkadese Maelstrom, a region of the Outer Rim Territories and the Slice that consisted of ionized gas, dust clouds, water vapor, ammonia, carbonbergs, and gravity wells. Pilot's End had been named by wary spacers and was situated near the Kessel system's world Kessel at the center of the Maelstrom. At some point between 10 BBY and approximately 1 ABY, the barkeep known as Midnight mentioned Pilot's End as one of Kessel's nearby hazards—and also included a map of the Akkadese Maelstrom with Pilot's End featured on it—in a book they were writing.

Behind the scenes
Pilot's End was mentioned in the 2018 book Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor, authored by Jason Fry and illustrated by Sam Gilbey.
