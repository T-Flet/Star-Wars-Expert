Takobo Spaceport Depot was a business in a local spaceport in Takobo City, the capital of the planet Takobo. The name of the business was written in red Aurebesh letters over a doorway outside a hangar area. The archway outside the door had a design similar to the entrance arch at Niima Outpost on the planet Jakku.

Behind the scenes
The archway outside the entrance to the depot was originally designed by Ralph McQuarrie for Jabba the Hutt's palace in the 1983 film Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.
