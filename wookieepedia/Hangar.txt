"Pilots, return to the hangar. The exercise is complete."
―Lieutenant Galek, to the First Order TIE pilots
Hangars, also known as docking bays or landing pads, were areas for launching, landing, repairing, and refueling vehicles. They were located on planetary surfaces, space stations, and starships large enough to carry smaller ships, such as shuttles, freighters, blockade frigates, and starfighters. Some ships like Imperial Star Destroyers had a tractor beam that could catch rebel ships and pull them into their hangar bays.
Some larger ships were designed to carry many other vessels. For example the Venator-class Star Destroyer used by the Galactic Republic could contain numerous starships and shuttles within its hangars.
The Executor-class Star Dreadnought Liberty's Misrule, formerly known as the Annihilator, by the pirates called Sovereign Latitudes of Maracavanya led by the zhe pirate Eleodie Maracavanya that the dreadnought's hangar bay were once ships, one of the encampments was known as Hangartown.
The modified parts of the Galactic Empire sail barge Galleon had a hangar for launching the skiffs to hunt a jakoosk on the ice moon Celsor 3.
