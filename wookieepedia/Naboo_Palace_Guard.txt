The Naboo Palace Guard, also referred to as the Royal Palace Guard, was one of three distinct divisions of the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Its members protected the Monarch of Naboo and other dignitaries. They were mostly seen around and in the Royal Palace's grounds. They would also serve as bodyguards for certain public officials, such as Padmé Amidala when she served as the Senator of Naboo in the Senate of the Galactic Republic. Her detail was led by Captain Gregar Typho.
Several members of the Guard gave their lives assisting Jedi Master Kelleran Beq in his rescue of Grogu from the siege of the Jedi Temple.
