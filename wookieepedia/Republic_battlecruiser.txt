Ships referred to as Republic battlecruisers by Aleema Keto participated in the Republic fleet blockading Onderon during the Naddist Revolt in 3998 BBY. Another, more general term for them was Republic military ships.

Characteristics
Though varying in appearance, some of the more prominent vessels in the blockade were marked by elongated hulls, raised command towers and extended flaps connected to the main hull near the stern. The ships were less massive than the battleships used by the peacekeeping forces later in the Great Sith War.

History
When Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma requested assistance during the Second Battle of Onderon, the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic sent a War Fleet of the Republic to aide his force against the Naddists.

    The Krath Enchanter evades the Republic blockade.  
The Krath leaders, Satal and Aleema Keto encountered the War Fleet as they tried to gain access to Onderon. They managed to evade the battlecruisers and dove for the surface, even after being warned off by Wing 3.
