Slave Quarters Row, also called the Slave Quarter, was a section of Mos Espa, a spaceport city on Tatooine. It consisted of a series of small hovels stacked atop each other that were originally built by the mining companies who first colonized Tatooine. In the last decades of the Galactic Republic, however, those hovels served as homes for the city's slave population, hence the name "Slave Quarter." Anakin Skywalker lived out his childhood years with his mother, Shmi, in the Slave Quarter, when the two of them were owned by a Toydarian junk dealer named Watto.

Behind the scenes
The real-world locations for the Slave Quarters are Ksar Hadada, Ksar Medenine and Ksar Ouled Soltane in Tunisia.
