"(chuckles) Wrong button."
â€•General Grievous, after accidentally dispensing Bibble UP
Bibble UP was a beverage that shared its name with the governor of Naboo, Sio Bibble. The cloning device referred to as a "new and improved version" of the Clone-amatic 11-38 on the Subjugator-class heavy cruiser Malevolence was capable of dispensing Bibble UP. The beverage was stored in an orange and silver can with white stripes and a white label reading "Bibble UP" in the High Galactic alphabet.
In 21 BBY, General Grievous accidentally dispensed Bibble UP from the new and improved Clone-amatic while attemping to clone the Force-sensitive clone Jek-14 due to having pressed the wrong button. When the Sith Lord Count Dooku reacted with contempt, Grievous chuckled before tossing the can aside.

Behind the scenes
Bibble UP appeared in "Menace of the Sith," the second episode of LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles, which aired on Cartoon Network on September 4, 2013.
