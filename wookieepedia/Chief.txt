"Chieftain Thi-Sen welcomes you to his home and hopes you come in peace."
―C-3PO
Chief, sometimes known as chieftain, was a title used in various organizations and cultures to denote a position of authority. During the Clone Wars, Thi-Sen was the chieftain of Talz on Orto Plutonia; Nossor Ri was the chieftain of the Quarren on Mon Cala; Pieter was the chieftain of the Ming Po village on Carlac; Tarfful was the chieftain of Kachirho on Kashyyyk; and Qin Yazal was the chieftain of a Poletec village.
In the Galactic Empire, chief was a military rank, and was used by such individuals as Moradmin Bast and Siward Cass. In Bright Tree Village, an Ewok village on the forest moon of Endor, Chief Chirpa was the leader of the tribe.
