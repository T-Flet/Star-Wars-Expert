"Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth."
―Rey
The Legends of Luke Skywalker is a canon young-readers novel of myths and tall tales about the legendary Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. It was written by Ken Liu and was released by Disney–Lucasfilm Press on October 31, 2017, as part of the Journey to Star Wars: The Last Jedi publishing program.
The frame story of the novel follows children on their way to the casino world of Canto Bight. The children tell each other six stories about Skywalker, debating whether or not he was a myth. The stories include a firsthand account, told secondhand, of a mole-flea named Lugubrious Mote, who claimed to have been with Skywalker during the rescue of Han Solo.

Publisher's summary
As a cargo ship rockets across the galaxy to Canto Bight, the deckhands on board trade stories about legendary Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. But are the stories of iconic and mysterious Luke Skywalker true, or merely tall tales passed from one corner of the galaxy to another? Is Skywalker really a famous Jedi hero, an elaborate charlatan, or even part droid? The deckhands will have to decide for themselves when they hear The Legends of Luke Skywalker.
A collection of myths and tall-tales about the legendary Jedi Luke Skywalker, written by Nebula, Hugo, and World Fantasy award-winning author Ken Liu.

Legacy
At New York Comic Con 2019 it was announced that Viz Media would publish a manga adaptation of the novel in 2020.
