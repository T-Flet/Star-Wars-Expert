Plot Summary
Onslaught
The Sith Empire has set their sights on the Republic's Meridian Complex Shipyard on Corellia and has gathered a massive fleet led by Sith Lord Darth Malgus to secure their victory. Meanwhile, the Republic plans to reinforce their own defenses by gathering reinforcements from Onderon and Mek-Sha. The Alliance Commander is at the center stage of the first stage of the renewed war.

Pinnacles of Power
After the Battle of the Meridian Complex, The Republic and Empire have assembled their specialized organizations; Task Force Nova and the Hand of the Empire respectively to face the turn of the tide. Meanwhile, the Alliance Commander learns of Darth Malgus' suspicious disappearance after the battle and with their worst fears being realized that he has indeed gone rogue.

Echoes of Vengeance
The transport holding Satele and her students has been located, the Alliance Commander with Kira Carsen and Scourge race against time to save their allies before the machinations of the Sith Emperor succeed but they must face against both old and new followers of the Emperor. Shae Vizla has been responding to unprovoked attacks on Mandalorian transports and Jekiah Ordo suggests baiting the unknown force out of hiding at the risk of death.

The Dark Descent
The rogue Sith Lord Darth Malgus has been sighted near the ruins of the old Jedi Enclave on Dantooine! The Sith Empire and Republic rally strike teams to intercept Malgus before he is able to complete his nefarious schemes against both factions.
