Endor Limited was the seventh full expansion set of the Star Wars Customizable Card Game, a card game based on Star Wars. It consisted of 180 cards (90 Dark Side and 90 Light Side cards) and was introduced in June of 1999. This set consisted of 80 rare, 50 uncommon, and 50 common cards. This set introduced many of the classic characters from Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi that were involved with the events occurring on Endor. This set also introduced Ewoks, speeder bikes, and Scout Troopers to game play. Some of the notable cards included Daughter of Skywalker, Wicket, and Wokling.
This set was sold in 9-card expansion packs and 30-pack expansion boxes. Each pack included one rare card, three uncommon cards, and five common cards. Starter decks were never produced for this set. This set was unique in that it included an 18-card foil subset, consisting of 8 common foils, 6 uncommon foils, and 4 rare foils. Foil sets were difficult to complete, as the foils were scarce. Common foils averaged about three per box, uncommon about one in every two boxes, and rare foils only one in every three boxes.

Continuity
This set was the original source for the names of many characters from Episode VI. This included many Imperial officers and troopers, notably Corporal Dyer as played by sound designer Ben Burtt, and Major Marquand as played by the film's director Richard Marquand. In the new Star Wars canon Marquand's character would be renamed Newland.
The set also first named several Rebel officers and troops seen on Endor and on Home One in the film. The name of existing Legends character Lieutenant Page was applied to one of these characters. Several Ewok characters were first named here as well.

Inconsistencies
According to Leland Chee's blog on StarWars.com, he speculated that Decipher, Inc. used pictures of the same actor to represent Rebels Corporal Delevar and Sergeant Brooks Carlson on their respective CCG cards. Carlson was portrayed by stuntman Alf Joint, who was uncredited in the role.
