"This is Imperial Patrol Frigate Guardstar. Please step down from defensive posture and transmit identification and authorization beams."
â€•The crew of the Guardstar to the Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft Slave I
The Guardstar was an Imperial Patrol Frigate in the Imperial Navy by the time of the Galactic Civil War fought between the Galactic Empire and the Alliance to Restore the Republic. In 3 ABY, the Guardstar was orbiting Tatooine, a planet in the Tatoo system. That year, the bounty hunter Boba Fett assisted the Empire in subjugating Bespin, a planet in the Bespin system.
Fett departed Bespin aboard his Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft, Slave I. After reaching the Tatoo system, the Guardstar intercepted Slave I outside Tatooine. The frigate's crew demanded for Fett to step down from his defensive posture and transmit his identification and authorization beams. Fett responded with a priority code given to him by Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, whose hologram appeared on the bridge of the Guardstar, saying that Slave I traveled under Vader's personal protection and would have no Imperial detainment. Slave I thus landed on Tatooine with no further interruption.

Behind the scenes
The Guardstar was created for 1990's "Dark Voyage to Tatooine," a story published in West End Games' Galaxy Guide 5: Return of the Jedi sourcebook written by Michael Stern.
