Joval Rykk was a male human who served in the Stormtrooper Corps of the Galactic Empire. By the time of the blockade of the Anoat sector, Rykk was a ten-year veteran of the Corps, and yet he did not feel any loyalty to his Empire or even his comrades in arms.



This section of the article assumes 100% game completion of Star Wars: Uprising. Any alternate stories may be noted in the "Behind the scenes" section. The events in this section may or may not have been confirmed as canon.

Several months into the blockade, Rykk was recruited by the Smuggler, who sent him on a variety of missions across the sector. Although Rykk was still a member of the Imperial military, he was willing to overlook anything the Smuggler asked him for the right price.

Assumption ends here.
