Sola was a female Human communication officer of the Galactic Republic living during the Galactic War with the reconstituted Sith Empire. In 3639 BBY she was stationed on the Thranta-class corvette Outrider that was assigned by Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh to investigate Hutt Cartel military activity in the Vyron system. Upon jumping out of Hyperspace, the crew witnesses the end of the battle involving the Hutt Cartel forces and reported the situation to Saresh. Captain Hardin then took the corvette to Nal Hutta, where a strike team shuttled down to the surface to discuss the matter with Cartel leader Karagga. The confrontation ended in violence and Karagga was killed, leaving the position of the Supreme Mogul vacant.
