"Good thing those bugs can't aim."
â€•The Clone trooper, referring to the Geonosians
A clone trooper was present at the beginning of the Second Battle of Geonosis. He joked about how the Geonosians did not aim well while traveling in a Republic Gunship. Ironically, moments after he said this everyone present in the ship died from a direct hit by the Geonosians.

Behind the scenes
The clone trooper first appeared in the 2009 episode of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.
