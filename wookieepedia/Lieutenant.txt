"Did I say something wrong, captain?""I believe you've made a mistake, sir. You are captain. I am merely lieutenant."
â€•Captain Punfor and Lieutenant Magna Tolvan
Lieutenant was a low level commissioned rank utilized primarily by various military forces such as the Grand Army of the Republic, which used Clone Lieutenants, the Imperial Army, and by police services such as the Coruscant Security Force. It could also be used as a title in various organizations such as the Trade Federation to mean someone who was second in command. For a time, Luke Skywalker held this rank within the Rebel Alliance.
Within the Imperial Military there was also the rank of Junior Lieutenant, and one Junior Lieutenant in the Galactic Empire was Jams. Another variant of the rank was Senior Lieutenant. Kaydel Ko Connix held the rank of Lieutenant in the Resistance decades after the Galactic Civil War.
