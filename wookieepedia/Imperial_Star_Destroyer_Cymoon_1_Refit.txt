The Imperial Star Destroyer Cymoon 1 Refit was a refit of the Galactic Empire's Imperial-class Star Destroyer, manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Measuring 1,600 meters in length and possessing armaments, the gray, wedge-shaped vessel had a conning tower with an ISD-72x shield generator dome on either side and a communications tower in between them. At some point, an Imperial Star Destroyer Cymoon 1 Refit was present near a celestial body next to a smaller astronomical object. The refit shared its name with the moon Cymoon 1, which contained a massive Imperial weapons factory.

Behind the scenes
The Imperial Star Destroyer Cymoon 1 Refit was mentioned on a card in the Chimaera Expansion Pack of the miniatures game Star Wars: Armada, which was released by Fantasy Flight Games on February 4, 2018. The image used to represent the refit was previously used on a card part of the October 8, 2015 Star Wars: The Card Game expansion Imperial Entanglements, a part of the Star Wars Legends continuity, which depicted the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Chimaera.
