Publisher's summary
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ...
Four years after the Battle of Endor, the struggle against the remnants of the Empire continues. A New Republic task force has been dispatched to the distant Kathol sector to topple rogue warlord Moff Sarne. During the battle, the New Republic discovers mysterious artifacts known as "DarkStryder technology."
Join the crew of the Corellian Corvette FarStar as they scour the fringes of the Empire in search of Sarne and the source of the DarkStryder technology!

Kaiya Adrimetrum—A New Republic commando, Kaiya is eager for revenge against the Empire.
Gorak Khzam—The FarStar's security officer claims to be an independent trader.
Darryn Thyte—Thyte is the communications officer no ship in the New Republic wanted. The FarStar got him.
Jessa Dajus—Imperial officer Dajus has inside information on Sarne's plans, but her loyalty is held in question.
Loh'khar the Finder—The Twi'lek "procurement specialist" who can cut any deal ... any deal at all.
Ranna "Wing-Ripper" Gorjaye—The FarStar's fighter commander, Gorjaye knows there are two ways to do things: her way and the wrong way.
